# mvc-aop-jpa-lombok
A small project that serves as a starting point for spring-boot, jpa and lombok. My prefered stack.

Features:
Spring boot: AOP, JPA, Web
PostgreSQL database
Lombok *(Google Lombok IntelliJ or Lombok Eclipse to configure your IDE)
JOOL better lambdas by JOOQ
Gson serialization
Retrofit to consume rest apis
There is a small database and documentation in spanish (code in english)

To-dos
*Add spring security
*Add Jool examples
*Documentation in english

Conclusions
I am very happy with this stack. I like how clean aop jpa lombok are doing. I will develop projects based on this and refine as needed. Any comment or help is welcome.
